@_snoozbuster and @jon_fisch's entry for LD30 - Connected Worlds.

There's a PHP component of this regarding pastebin world upload and download. This isn't going to be committed,
because it contains both a private API key and a username/password combination. However, it's just a couple ideas
combined from [Pastebin's API](http://pastebin.com/api); I copied most of their code verbatim with only minor changes.

I don't mind if you use the code; some of the DLLs in `/AD_core` aren't mine and those are covered by their respective
licenses. Music is copyright Luminescent Breakfast, used with permission. Models and images are also free to use, for the 
most part.
